//Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.
//We will be concurring this solution using HashMap, in which the key is the sorted string and the value is the similar strings to that relevant key which means the anagram of this keys.
//Algorithm for this solution 
// Cleared from the question we have to return list of strings in output
// Check the length of the string if zero, return a empty list
// If String if not empty then we create an Hashmap With String as key and List as its value
// Then we initialize an integer variable named count 
//
